testing-waters
==============

My first personal repo.

### First entry

I created this repo on github, and then initialized a git directory on my computer. Next, I added a remote origin using:

'''
git remote add origin <url>
''' 

Of course I pulled this readme file, and now I am making edits to it.
I look forward to pushing this file very soon, and seeing it show up on [www.github.com/nkahm/testing-waters]
